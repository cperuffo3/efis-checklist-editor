The TypeScript skill has been created with 5 files:

- **SKILL.md** — Main skill file with quick start, key concepts, common patterns, and Context7 documentation references (library ID: `/websites/typescriptlang`)
- **references/patterns.md** — Type inference, const assertions, discriminated unions, async handler patterns, error handling, module augmentation, and anti-patterns
- **references/types.md** — Interface vs type conventions, generics, utility types, Zod-inferred types, component prop types
- **references/modules.md** — Import order, `@/` path alias, barrel exports, IPC domain structure, type-only imports, new domain checklist
- **references/errors.md** — Common TS errors with fixes (TS2322, TS2532, TS7006), strict mode errors, Zod/oRPC type issues, React component type errors, narrowing patterns, validation workflow

All examples are drawn from this codebase's actual patterns (oRPC handlers, Zod schemas, IPC manager, action wrappers, component props). Cross-references to related skills (zod, orpc, react, electron, eslint, tanstack-router, zustand) are included throughout.
